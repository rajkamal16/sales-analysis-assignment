# Promo Analysis Assignment

## Overview
This project analyzes customer purchases of items `x`, `y`, and `z` from a promotional sale. The goal is to summarize total quantities bought per customer aged 18-35 and export the results as CSV files.

## Project Files
- `setup_db.py`: Creates and populates the SQLite database (`database.db`) with sample data for testing.
- `Main_SQL.py`: Runs a SQL query to extract the required data and saves it as `output_sql.csv`.
- `Main_Python.py`: Uses Python and pandas to perform the same extraction and saves it as `output_pandas.csv`.
- `database.db`: The SQLite database file generated by `setup_db.py`.
- `output_sql.csv`: Output CSV from the SQL version.
- `output_pandas.csv`: Output CSV from the pandas version.

## How to Run

1. **Set up the database:**  
   Run `setup_db.py` once to create `database.db` and insert test data.  
   ```bash
   python setup_db.py

**Run SQL version:**
  Extract data using a pure SQL query and save to CSV.
  

**Run Python/pandas version:**
Extract data using pandas and save to CSV.
